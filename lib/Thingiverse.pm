# ABSTRACT: library to interface with Thingiverse's REST API:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base Class for client library to interface with Thingiverse's REST API

//http://www.thingiverse.com/developers/rest-api-reference

Main purposes for this base class is to hold global values like the api_uri_base, 
pagination maxium, debug/verbosity flags for debugging, and the access_token used
for authentication/authorization to the API.  It also serves to make and store
the rest_client attribute which all the sub classes will need and use.

=method rest_client

The client object that will be used to complete all requests.

=method verbosity

The verbosity level of the client connections.

Request Methods

Each of these methods makes an HTTP request, sets the internal state of the object, and returns the object.

They can be combined with the response methods, such as:

  print $client->GET('/search/?q=foobar')->responseContent();


* GET ( $url, [%$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP GET to the resource specified. Takes an optional hashref of custom request headers.

* PUT ($url, [$body_content, %$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP PUT to the resource specified. Takes an optional body content and hashref of custom request headers.

* PATCH ( $url, [$body_content, %$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP PATCH to the resource specified. Takes an optional body content and hashref of custom request headers.

* POST ( $url, [$body_content, %$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP POST to the resource specified. Takes an optional body content and hashref of custom request headers.

* DELETE ( $url, [%$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP DELETE to the resource specified. Takes an optional hashref of custom request headers.

* OPTIONS ( $url, [%$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP OPTIONS to the resource specified. Takes an optional hashref of custom request headers.

* HEAD ( $url, [%$headers] )
  Preform an HTTP HEAD to the resource specified. Takes an optional hashref of custom request headers.

* request ( $method, $url, [$body_content, %$headers] )
  Issue a custom request, providing all possible values.

Response Methods

Use these methods to gather information about the last requset performed.

* responseCode ()
  Return the HTTP response code of the last request

* responseContent ()
  Return the response body content of the last request

* responseHeaders()
  Returns a list of HTTP header names from the last response

* responseHeader ( $header )
  Return a HTTP header from the last response

* responseXpath ()
  A convienience wrapper that returns a XML::LibXML xpath context for the body content. Assumes the content is XML.
